This plugin is firstly imported from Ruby's filetype plugin.  But there are many differences between Ruby and Crystal and vim-crystal can't support all of them.  And Crystal is growing rapidly and being added many changes.  If you found some issues or points to improve, pull requests and issues are welcome.
