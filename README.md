This plugin was firstly imported from Ruby's filetype plugin.  There are many differences between Ruby and Crystal but vim-crystal can't support all of them yet.  In addition, Crystal is growing rapidly and being added many changes.  If you've found some issues or points to improve, pull requests and issues are welcome.
